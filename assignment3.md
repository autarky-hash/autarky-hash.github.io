## Part 1: Making a construction kit

Create a grasshopper definition of a clip and 3D print the clip. Your clip should allow you to connect a piece of cardboard to another piece of cardboard. Your grasshopper definition should allow you to vary the thickness of the cardboard. Print at least 10 clips and clip pieces of cardboard together with them. If you pick up your clipped together cardboard and shake it, it should not fall apart! Submit the grasshopper definition, your STL, and a video of you shaking your construction.

## Part 2: Making nested objects

Create a grasshopper definition that creates nesting structures (E.g. using offsets) that can be 3D printed in their nested state. You should have at least 3 nesting structures. Bake the result, export an STL, and 3D print the nested structure. The geometry can be whatever you want. Submit the rhino file, the grasshopper definition, your STL, and documentation of the print.
