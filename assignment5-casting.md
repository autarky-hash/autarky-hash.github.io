## Part 2: Casting/Beginning of Final Project

Intro: I wanted to create bike trophies for my work team (I work on delivery bikes). The bike that we used is custom manufactured so there is no STL file readily available. I also wanted to make an assortment of other bikes for my co-workers themed after things they worked on as well.

## Photoshop/AI Edit: 
I actually started by tracing the (grainy) bike model of the file that we had at work. I took the initial photo and colored in black and white to omit the detail. I also deleted some detail I didn't want (like small text), wheels, etc.
In Illustrator, I did an image trace and then cleaned up stuff like curves in detail, making some curves wider so that it would be easier to print.

## Rhino:
In Rhino, I imported the AI file and then extruded the model of the bike. Then I turned on Draft Angle Analysis to be able to see all surfaces.

I then broke up the bike into 3 poly surfaces per side. For the more complex side, it was actually relatively straightforward- I exploded the polysurface
