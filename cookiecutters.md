## Assignment 1: My First Rhino Model!
Using Rhino, create 3 different "cookie cutter" (like these: https://www.treelittletree.com/maple-leaf-cookie-cutter.html (Links to an external site.)) shapes, and export them as STLs. Your cookie cutters should be a reasonable cookie size, e.g. between 1 and 6 inches. Your shapes have to come from images, i.e. you must create curves in illustrator or some other program and import them into Rhino, then build a solid model using those curves. Each STL must contain only one surface, which should not self-intersect or have other discontinuities. Document your process on your webpage, linking to your rhino model, your STLs, and your original image source files.
FAQ!
Q: Do I have to use Rhino? A: Yes
Q: Do I have to use Illustrator? A: No, you may also use other programs for image and vector manipulation such as Inkscape or Gimp.
Q: Can I use an svg/ai/existing vector file to make my shapes? A: No, you must generate your geometry from an image.
Q: Do I have to make the image myself or can I use existing images? A: You can use whatever images, as long as you give the original image creators attribution.
Q: Do I have to use github? A: Yes! You must include documentation and source files linked to from your github hosted webpage.
## Step 1: Photo Selection
I originally chose the following photos: <p>

## Step 2: Background Removal in Photoshop and Illustrator
I removed the background in Photoshop of each photo, converted the photo to black and white with high contrast, put the photos into gaussian blur and then thresholded the photo. I cropped the photos to relevant parts and then imported the files to Illustrator where I then did an image trace. After image trace, I meticulously removed artifacts, smoothed the points and reconciled any additional image issues. I also removed the fill and added a stroke to each image so that the image would resemble an outline that can be in Rhino. <p>

## Why do I want to learn about digital fabrication
I want to learn about 3D printing prototyping capabilities that I can use to realize my own ideas. I'm interested in how 3D printing can be converted to production and how to turn ideas into commercial realities. From working in supply chain in the past, I realize how complex it is to have another designer turn ideas and tradeoffs into production level work and I want to understand the tradeoffs.
## What do I hope to learn in the class
I want to learn 3D prototyping end to end as well as experiment with other tools I can use to prototype. For example, laser cutting, cricuts (etc) that can be used cohesively ot make a prototype. I also want to learn about the limitations as well as potential (e.g., can I buy a bigger 3D printer?) 
## What do I want to teach my peers
I want to teach my peers about business and commercial applications if that is a segment of the class. I'm pretty well versed in the end to end supply chain and the design and build model of manufacturing. I'd like to bridge the gap between 3D Printing as a hobby to 3D printing as a business opportunity.
