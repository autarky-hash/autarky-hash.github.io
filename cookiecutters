##Assignment 1: My First Rhino Model!
Using Rhino, create 3 different "cookie cutter" (like these: https://www.treelittletree.com/maple-leaf-cookie-cutter.html (Links to an external site.)) shapes, and export them as STLs. Your cookie cutters should be a reasonable cookie size, e.g. between 1 and 6 inches. Your shapes have to come from images, i.e. you must create curves in illustrator or some other program and import them into Rhino, then build a solid model using those curves. Each STL must contain only one surface, which should not self-intersect or have other discontinuities. Document your process on your webpage, linking to your rhino model, your STLs, and your original image source files.
