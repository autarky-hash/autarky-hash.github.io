## Why do I want to learn about digital fabrication
I want to learn about 3D printing prototyping capabilities that I can use to realize my own ideas. I'm interested in how 3D printing can be converted to production and how to turn ideas into commercial realities. From working in supply chain in the past, I realize how complex it is to have another designer turn ideas and tradeoffs into production level work and I want to understand the tradeoffs.
## What do I hope to learn in the class
I want to learn 3D prototyping end to end as well as experiment with other tools I can use to prototype. For example, laser cutting, cricuts (etc) that can be used cohesively ot make a prototype. I also want to learn about the limitations as well as potential (e.g., can I buy a bigger 3D printer?) 
## What do I want to teach my peers
I want to teach my peers about business and commercial applications if that is a segment of the class. I'm pretty well versed in the end to end supply chain and the design and build model of manufacturing. I'd like to bridge the gap between 3D Printing as a hobby to 3D printing as a business opportunity.
