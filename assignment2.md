## Assignment 2: Getting Started with 3D Printer
Assemble your 3D printer and document the process on your website. Include the following steps:
First, conduct the bed leveling protocol from Filament Friday: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3235018 (Links to an external site.)
Once your bed is well leveled, print the following test prints:
A 2cm cube with the standard "low quality" settings 
A 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings 
A 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings
If you are having adhesion issues, we recommend slowing down the initial layer to half speed and/or  try using a "BRIM" for build plat adhesion.
A 2 cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer and your favorite print setting from the previous cubes.
Next, we will print tubes: 

A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness
A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment
A cylinder 3cm in diameter exported with a 0.1mm tolerance
A cylinder 3cm in diameter exported with a 0.001mm tolerance
A cylinder 3cm in diameter with special mode "spiralize outer contour".
A cylinder 3cm in diameter printed on its side with supports on.
For each of these prints, document how long they took, and measure their height/width with calipers and and document their sizes. 

20.0mm +/- 0.1mm cube with a 10.0mm +/- 0.1mm hole through it.
To do this, you will need to calibrate your print settings by measuring output from your printer with your calipers. It is likely you will have to print this several times to get it to tolerance!
## Step 1: Assemble Printer
Due to the fact that my printer arrived many days later and I had to resort to Amazon Prime the day before the assignment is due, I first spent many hours assembling the printer, making sure that the screws were tightened, filament was inserted and that the connections were correct. The most complex part of this process was actually trying to understand why the printer did not turn on- which I found from the slide deck (and not in the printer instructions) was due to moving the switch in the back to a different voltage. A huge learning was also in the fact hat  also in the movement of the cables which got int he awy of the printer. 

## Step 2: Level Plate
I leveled the plate in 2 different ways- one with a piece of paper manually and then moving the knobs underneath the printer until the filament touched the plate. I also did this again with the bed leveling protocol from Filament Friday by loading the files onto the SD card and then onto the machine.

## ERROR! Homing Failed
I got stuck on homing failed on the machine, Please reset multiple times. Sometimes I manage to exit the error by turning the machine on and off again or by moving the printer head or by moving the cables I always inevitably ended up back at Homing Failed.

## ERROR! Leveling Print in 1 Line
I tried to create a leveling print with the Filament Friday leveling file but instead the printer only moved on 1 axis repeatedly and created a straight line. After I started the print, the printer didn't show an error but also didn't move in the square box they showed me. 

## ERROR! Nozzle Stuck
After the printing in 1 line, the printer then printed on itself repeatedly until the nozzle got stuck. Thanks our class Discord, Kenny (shoutout!) told me to heat up the PLA which released the misprint. 

## Step 3: Rhino Model- Cube Test Print
I created a Rhino Model of the cube first through the Solid -> Cube function. I also used a centimeter template for the model.

## Step 4: Rhino Files (for Reference)


## Lessons Learned
-Contrasting Images are easier to adjust because the background does not interfere that much to clip a clean image.
-This is an iterative process. Sometimes I have to go back to photoshop or illustrator to get a clean Rhino image.
-I struggled with the complexity of the dancer link and could not eliminate the intersecting curves. Some of the other curves (like the Yoga one) was way easier
